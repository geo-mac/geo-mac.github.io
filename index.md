# Me...

My name is George.  My interests are in structured open data (esp. within Semantic Web and repository contexts),  information retrieval, distributed digital repositories and  human-computer interaction (HCI).

I am a [repository manager and developer](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/macgregorgeorgemr/) based at the  [University of Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/).  I work on repositories, support [colleagues](http://www.strath.ac.uk/rkes/) in delivering our [CRIS](http://www.eurocris.org) and generally support institutional activities in the areas of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and digital scholarship.  I am part of a small team, known as  "Scholarly Publications & Research Data", which works in the area of repositories, research discovery, research data management and [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access). I am currently completing a PhD in topics surrounding resource discovery at the [iSchool](https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/subjects/computerinformationscience/strathclydeischoolresearchgroup/).

- I am [Technical Officer](http://ukcorr.org/committee/) on the [UKCoRR](http://ukcorr.org/) Committee  
- I am core dev for the [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/)
- I am a [CORE Ambassador](https://blog.core.ac.uk/2019/10/16/core-ambassador-george-macgregor/) 
- I chair the [RIOXX Metadata Application Profile](https://rioxx.net/) [Governance Group (RGG)](http://www.rioxx.net/governance/).

I am also a chartered member (MCLIP) of the [Chartered Institute of Library & Information Professionals (CILIP)](http://www.cilip.org.uk/) and a registered Fellow ([FHEA](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/fellow/applying-to-become-a-fellow)) of the UK [Higher Education Academy](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/).  

## Previously...

Prior to returning to repositories I worked as a Project Evaluator & Business Analyst on the Jisc funded [Principles in Patterns](http://www.principlesinpatterns.ac.uk/) (PiP) project and, before that, as a Lecturer in Information Management & Systems at [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/). I worked at LJMU for almost 5 years, lecturing in the broad areas of  information retrieval, structured data, and information architecture,  and developing research interests in distributed digital repositories  and Semantic Web technologies. I also developed a peripheral interest in learning technology and e-pedagogy during this time. 

In the more  distant past I was a Research Assistant and then Research Fellow based  at the [Centre for Digital Library Research](https://www.strath.ac.uk/cdlr/) in the [Department of Computer and Information Sciences](http://www.strath.ac.uk/cis/), [University of Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/).
