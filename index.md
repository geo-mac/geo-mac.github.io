My name is George.  My interests are in structured open data (esp. within Semantic Web and repository contexts),  resource discovery, distributed digital repositories and  human-computer interaction (HCI).

I am a [repository manager and developer](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/macgregorgeorgemr/) based in the "Scholarly Publications & Research Data" team at the  [University of Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/).  I work on repository and digital library things, while also supporting activities within [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), research discovery and digital scholarship. I am currently completing a PhD in topics surrounding resource discovery at the [iSchool](https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/subjects/computerinformationscience/strathclydeischoolresearchgroup/).

At the moment...

- I chair the [RIOXX Metadata Application Profile](https://rioxx.net/) [Governance Group (RGG)](http://www.rioxx.net/governance/)
- I sit on the [Jisc Digital Research Community Group](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/get-involved/digital-research-community-group)
- I am [Technical Officer](http://ukcorr.org/committee/) on the [UKCoRR](http://ukcorr.org/) Committee  
- I am core dev for the [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/)
- I am a [CORE Ambassador](https://blog.core.ac.uk/2019/10/16/core-ambassador-george-macgregor/) 

I am also a chartered member (MCLIP) of the [Chartered Institute of Library & Information Professionals (CILIP)](http://www.cilip.org.uk/) and a registered Fellow ([FHEA](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/fellow/applying-to-become-a-fellow)) of the UK [Higher Education Academy](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/).
